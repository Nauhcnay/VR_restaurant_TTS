spk5= 3
s6 = Thus, we use restaurant service as an example of psychomotor skill,
spk6= 3
s7 = and adaptively train trainees to develop restaurant skills and practice multitasking in a virtual restaurant.
spk7= 3
s8 = Here is the overview of our approach.
spk8= 3
s9 = We first obtain trainee performance from the current training session, which includes the number of hints asked, the number of mistakes made and the walking path, and so on. 
spk9= 3
s10 = Then our optimizer generates the next training session by solving the multi-objectives optimization problem. 
spk10= 3
s11 = Specifically, the output of optimization includes a set of tasks with suitable difficulty for the next training sessions.
spk11= 3
s12 = We created a virtual restaurant that contains four tables, one food counter, and one Point of sale machine.  
spk12= 3
s13 = For this virtual restaurant, we design eight tasks to represent major customer requests restaurant staff need to handle in their daily work routine. 
spk13= 3
s14 = Each task has a property and is used for multitasking strategy training.
spk14= 3
s15 = The trainee uses the left-hand controller for switching tools between a food tray, a clean-up tool, and a notepad.
spk15= 3
s16 = The trainee also uses an interaction panel to interact with customers.
spk16= 3
s17 = Once the trainee’s speech is recognized and matches with the current task's desired response, the customer will respond or react.
spk17= 3
s18 = A typical training session is shown as follows: 
spk18= 3
s19 = A Trainee first walks to a table and interacts with customers to get a request.
spk19= 3
s20 = Then she walks to the POS machine for placing an order or goes to the food counter to get items for their customers. 
spk20= 3
s21 = After that, she goes back to the table to deliver the item for completion. 
spk21= 3
s22 = We consider four objectives in generating the next training session.
spk22= 3
s23 =  First, we have repeated mistake avoidance to let trainee practice more if he repeated made mistakes.
spk23= 3
s24 = We have familiarity of workflow objective to evaluate whether the trainee understands and members hte workflow of a task.
spk24= 3
s25 = The tolerance of repetition objective to balance repetition and a trainee’s interests during training. 
spk25= 3
s26 = The eagerness to learn objective to to review occasionally played tasks to reinforce their learning.
spk26= 3
s27 = We also introduce a set of constraints to avoid duplicated tasks, limit training session length, 
spk27= 3
s28 = and most importantly to increase multitasking training difficulty. 
spk28= 3
s29 = We use used Mixed integer programming to solve this multi-objective problem.
spk29= 3
s30 = We validate our approach through two experimental studies.
spk30= 3
s31 = In one of the experiments, we conduct a virtual reality training experiment. 
spk31= 3
s32 = The goal of this experiment is to evaluate not onlyevaluate mastery of individual restaurant tasks but also trainees’ ability to apply multitasking strategies.
spk32= 3
s33 = We recruited 26 participants and randomly separate them into two conditions.
spk33= 3
s34 = We first gave a warm-up session for participants to familiar with the virtual environment and the controls. 
spk34= 3
s35 = Then we give a pre-evaluation session for participants to evaluate their background knowledge of serving in a restaurant.
spk35= 3
s36 = participants can practice their skills for five training iterations.
spk36= 3
s37 = In the end, we give a post-evaluation session that has the exact same task as in the pre-evaluation to the participants .
spk37= 3
s38 = We also asked them to fill out questionnaires after completing post-evaluation.
spk38= 3
s39 = Here we show trainee performances (in terms of the final score)  in pre-evaluation and post-evaluation trained by the MIP approach and the random assignment approach. 
spk39= 3
s40 = The amount of improvement by each approach is also shown
spk40= 3
s41 = Participants from the MIP approach receive higher final score than those from random assignment approach. 
spk41= 3
s42 = In our second study,  we perform a simulation experiment.
spk42= 3
s43 =  The goal of this experiment is to determine whether our approach can train people more efficiently compared to other approaches given a steadily-improving trainee as input. 
spk43= 3
s44 = We compared our approach with a random assignment approach and a partial MIP approach.
spk44= 3
s45 = For more details, please refer to our paper.
spk45= 3
s46 = Trainee taking the Partial-MIP approach training has the most improvement for all tasks in all three conditions.
spk46= 3
s47 =  The trainee taking the MIP approach has better improvement than when taking random assignment training.
spk47= 3
s48 = This is the end of our video.
spk48= 3
s49 = Thank you for watching. 
spk49= 3
