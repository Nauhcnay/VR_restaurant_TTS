s7 = We first obtain user performance from a training session, which includes number of hints asked, number of mistakes, walking path, and so on.

spk8= 225
s9 = Specifically, our optimizer assigns tasks with suitable difficulty for each training session while satisfying the multitasking strategy training goal.

s10 = We created a virtual restaurant that contains four tables, one food counter, and one Point of sale (POS) machine.  
spk10= 225
s11 = Users will use the left-hand controller for switching tools between a food tray, clean up tools, and a notebook.
spk11= 225
s12 = Users will use an interaction panel to interact with customers.
spk12= 225
s13 = Once the user’s speech is recognized and matches with the current task's desired response, the customer will respond or react.
spk13= 225
s14 = A typical training session is shown as follows: 
spk14= 225
s15 =  Users first walk to a table, interact with customers to get a request, then walk to the POS machine for placing an order or go to the food counter to get items for their customers. 
spk15= 225
s16 = After that, she will go back to the table to deliver the item for completion. 
spk16= 225
s17 = We included regular tasks such as taking orders, delivering food and checkout and so on.
spk17= 225
s18 = These simulate common incidents a restaurant server face at work.
spk18= 225
s19 = Each task has a property and is used for multitasking strategy training.
spk19= 225
s20 = We consider repeated mistake avoidance, familiarity of workflow, tolerance of repetition and eagerness objectives and use used Mixed integer programming to solve this problem.
spk20= 225
s21 = We also introduce a set of constraints to avoid duplicated tasks, limit training session length and most importantly perform multitasking strategy training practice.
spk21= 225
s22 = We validate our approach through two experimental studies.
spk22= 225
s23 =  In the first study, we perform a simulation experiment.
spk23= 225
s24 =  The goal of this experiment is to determine whether our approach can train people more efficiently compared to other approaches given a steadily-improved user as input. 
spk24= 225
s25 = A steadily-improved user would improve her performance, or keep same performance if she received training of that task.
spk25= 225
s26 = Therefore, this simulator will reduce the number of mistakes and hints asked from zero up to three randomly.
spk26= 225
s27 = We compared our approach with a random assignment approach and a partial MIP approach.
spk27= 225
s28 = We run this simulation 10 times for each approach. 
spk28= 225
s29 = We evaluate average improvement according to the reduction in the number of mistakes and hints.
spk29= 225
s30 = Here, we show the total average improvement calculated by number of hints and mistakes reduction for all three approach. 
spk30= 225
s31 = Users from partial MIP approach training has the most improvement for all tasks in all three conditions.
spk31= 225
s32 =  This is because the partial MIP approach only considers user performance regardless whether user are tired of doing repeated tasks.
spk32= 225
s33 =  In contrast, the user from MIP approach training has the second-best improvement because it takes eagerness in account and selects less frequently appear tasks for training.
spk33= 225
s34 = Users from random assignment have the worst performance because this approach assigns tasks randomly regardless user performance.
spk34= 225
s35 = In the second study, we compared our approach with the random assignment approach by evaluating their skill development in restaurant service. 
spk35= 225
s36 = The goal of this user study is not only to evaluate mastery of individual restaurant tasks but also users' ability to apply multitasking strategies.
spk36= 225
s37 = We teach users how to combine tasks in an optimal way at the beginning of the training.
spk37= 225
s38 = We recruited 26 participants and randomly separate them into two conditions.
spk38= 225
s39 =  We first gave a warm-up session for participants to familiar with the virtual environment and the controls. 
spk39= 225
s40 = Then we give a pre-evaluation for users to evaluate their background knowledge of serving in a restaurant.
spk40= 225
s41 = Users can practice their skills for five training iterations.
spk41= 225
s42 = In the end, we give a post-evaluation training that has the exact same task as in the pre-evaluation to users.
spk42= 225
s43 = We also asked users to fill out questionnaires after post-evaluation.
spk43= 225
s44 = Here we show the overall performance in completing the pre-evaluation session and post-evaluation session as well as the overall improvement of two condition groups. 
spk44= 225
s45 = Please note that improvement is the final score difference in post and pre-evaluation sessions.
spk45= 225
s46 = The average final score of MIP approach group is higher than that of random assignment group. 
spk46= 225
s47 = In general, more users in MIP approach agree that ‘tasks are carefully picked’ than the random approach.
spk47= 225
s48 = This is the end of our video.
spk48= 225
s49 = Thank you for watching. 
spk49= 225
